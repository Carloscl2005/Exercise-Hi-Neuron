# Exercise-Hi-Neuron

**Exercise-Hi-Neuron** is a small educational project built with **Streamlit** that allows users to visually and interactively explore how an **artificial neuron** works.

The application enables real-time experimentation by modifying inputs, weights, and bias to directly observe how the neuron’s output is computed.

The goal is not to build a complex neural network, but to clearly demonstrate the **core mechanics of a single artificial neuron**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project provides a **basic and intuitive introduction** to the mathematical behavior of an artificial neuron, making it easier to understand how:

- Inputs are combined with weights
- A bias influences the result
- The final output is calculated step by step

It is designed for learning and conceptual clarity rather than performance or scale.

## 🧩 Application Structure

The application is divided into **three interactive tabs**, each increasing in complexity:

1. **Single input neuron**  
   - One input value  
   - One weight  
   - Output calculation displayed in real time
   - 1D neuron

2. **Two-input neuron**  
   - Two input values  
   - Two weights  
   - Demonstrates weighted sum with multiple inputs
   - 2D neuron

3. **Three-input neuron with bias**  
   - Three input values  
   - Three weights  
   - Includes a bias term to show its effect on the final output
   - 3D neuron

This step-by-step progression increases complexity while keeping the inderlying neuron model unchanged

## 🌐 Deployment

The application is hosted on <a href="https://exercise-hi-neuron-csdas.streamlit.app/">**Streamlit Cloud**</a>, allowing easy access and execution without local setup.
